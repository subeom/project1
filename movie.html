                    <p>The Martian is a 2015 science fiction film directed by Ridley Scott and starring Matt Damon. The
                        Martian, a novel by Andy Weir, served as the screenplay adapted by Drew Goddard. The film
                        depicts an
                        astronaut's (Matt Damon) lone struggle to survive on Mars after being left behind, and efforts
                        to
                        rescue him and bring him home to Earth. It also stars Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Kristen
                        Wiig,
                        Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, Michael Peña, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie, Mackenzie
                        Davis,
                        Donald Glover, and Benedict Wong.</p>

                    <p>Produced through 20th Century Fox, the film is a co-production of the United States and the
                        United
                        Kingdom. Producer Simon Kinberg began developing the film after Fox optioned the novel in
                        March
                        2013, which Drew Goddard adapted into a screenplay and was initially attached to direct, but the
                        film did not move forward. Scott replaced Goddard, and with Damon in place as the main
                        character,
                        production was approved. Filming began in November 2014 and lasted approximately seventy days.
                        Twenty sets were built on one of the largest sound stages in the world in Budapest, Hungary.
                        Wadi
                        Rum in Jordan was also used for exterior filming.</p>

                    <p>The film premiered at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2015, while
                        the
                        London premiere was held on September 24, 2015. The film was released in the United Kingdom on
                        September 30, 2015, and in the United States on October 2, 2015, in 2D, 3D, IMAX 3D and 4DX.
                        It
                        received positive reviews and grossed over $630 million worldwide, becoming Scott's
                        highest-grossing
                        film to date, as well as the 10th-highest-grossing film of 2015. The Martian received praise for
                        its
                        direction, visual effects, musical score, screenplay, scientific accuracy, and likability,
                        largely
                        due to Damon's performance. It received several accolades, including the Golden Globe Award for
                        Best
                        Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, seven nominations at the 88th Academy Awards, including Best
                        Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay for Goddard, and the 2016 long form Hugo Award for Best
                        Dramatic
                        Presentation. Damon won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy
                        and
                        was nominated for several awards including the Academy Award for Best Actor, the BAFTA Award for
                        Best Actor in a Leading Role, and the Critic's Choice Award for Best Actor.</p>

                    <p>The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont,
                        based
                        on the 1982 Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. It tells the story of
                        banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for
                        the
                        murders of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the following two
                        decades,
                        he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and
                        becomes instrumental in a money-laundering operation led by the prison warden Samuel Norton (Bob
                        Gunton). William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore appear in supporting
                        roles.</p>

                    <p>Darabont purchased the film rights to King's story in 1987, but development did not begin until
                        five
                        years later, when he wrote the script over an eight-week period. Two weeks after submitting his
                        script to Castle Rock Entertainment, Darabont secured a $25 million budget to produce The
                        Shawshank
                        Redemption, which started pre-production in January 1993. While the film is set in Maine,
                        principal
                        photography took place from June to August 1993 almost entirely in Mansfield, Ohio, with the
                        Ohio
                        State Reformatory serving as the eponymous penitentiary. The project attracted many stars of the
                        time for the role of Andy, including Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, and Kevin Costner. Thomas Newman
                        provided the film's score.</p>

                    <p>While The Shawshank Redemption received positive reviews on its release, particularly for its
                        story
                        and the performances of Robbins and Freeman, it was a box-office disappointment, earning only
                        $16
                        million during its initial theatrical run. Many reasons were cited for its failure at the time,
                        including competition from films such as Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump, to the general
                        unpopularity
                        of prison films, lack of female characters, and even the title, which was considered to be
                        confusing
                        for audiences. It went on to receive multiple award nominations, including seven Academy Award
                        nominations, and a theatrical re-release that, combined with international takings, increased
                        the
                        film's box-office gross to $58.3 million.</p>

                    <p>Over 320,000 VHS copies were shipped throughout the United States, and based on its award
                        nominations and word of mouth, it became one of the top rented films of 1995. The broadcast
                        rights
                        were acquired following the purchase of Castle Rock by Turner Broadcasting System, and it was
                        shown
                        regularly on the TNT network starting in 1997, further increasing its popularity. It is now
                        considered by many to be one of the greatest films of the 1990s. As of 2017, the film is still
                        broadcast regularly, and is popular in several countries, with audience members and celebrities
                        citing it as a source of inspiration, and naming the film as a favorite in various surveys. In
                        2015,
                        the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film
                        Registry, finding it "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".</p>
