                    <p>Dexter is an American crime drama mystery television series that aired on Showtime from October
                        1,
                        2006, to September 22, 2013. Set in Miami, the series centers on Dexter Morgan (Michael C.
                        Hall),
                        a forensic technician specializing in bloodstain pattern analysis for the fictional Miami Metro
                        Police Department, who leads a secret parallel life as a vigilante serial killer, hunting down
                        murderers who have slipped through the cracks of the justice system. The show's first season was
                        derived from the novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter (2004), the first in a series of novels by Jeff
                        Lindsay. It was adapted for television by screenwriter James Manos Jr., who wrote the first
                        episode.
                        Subsequent seasons evolved independently of Lindsay's works.</p>

                    <p>In February 2008, reruns (edited down to a TV-14 rating) began to air on CBS in the wake of the
                        shortage of original programming ensuing from the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike, thus
                        the
                        reruns on CBS ended after one run of the first season. The series enjoyed mostly positive
                        reviews
                        throughout its run and popularity. The first four seasons have received universal acclaim,
                        although
                        reception dropped drastically as the series progressed. The show has also won many awards,
                        including
                        two Golden Globe awards won by Michael C. Hall and John Lithgow for their roles as Dexter Morgan
                        and
                        Arthur Mitchell, respectively. Season four aired its season finale on December 13, 2009, to a
                        record-breaking audience of 2.6 million viewers, making it the most-watched original series
                        episode
                        ever on Showtime at that time.</p>

                    <p>In April 2013, Showtime announced that season eight would be the final season of Dexter. The
                        season-eight premiere was the most watched Dexter episode with more than 3 million viewers total
                        for
                        all airings that night. The original broadcast of the series finale—shown at 9 pm on
                        September
                        22, 2013—drew 2.8 million viewers, the largest overall audience in Showtime's history.</p>
